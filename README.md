In this repository, we present our set of **Low-Fidelity Prototypes** developed during the [MIMBCD-UI](https://mimbcd-ui.github.io/) project. Mostly, the prototypes are developed using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) and [Mockplus Classic](https://www.mockplus.com/) tools. For more information about the available *prototypes* please follow the [Prototypes](https://github.com/MIMBCD-UI/meta/wiki/Prototypes) page on the [Wiki](https://github.com/MIMBCD-UI/meta/wiki) of the [`meta`](https://github.com/MIMBCD-UI/meta) information repository. We also have several demos to see in our [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPz4aTIVHekHXTxHTUOLmXw), please follow us.

## Roadmap

[![CII Best Practices](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/projects/3819/badge)](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/projects/3819)

We need to follow the repository goal, by addressing the thereby information. Therefore, it is of chief importance to scale this solution supported by the repository. The repository solution follows the best practices, achieving the [Core Infrastructure Initiative (CII)](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/en/projects/3172) specifications.

Besides that, one of our goals involves creating a configuration file to automatically test and publish our code to pip or any other package manager. It will be most likely prepared for the [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions). Other goals may be written here in the future.

## Contributing

This project exists thanks to all the people who [contribute](CONTRIBUTING.md). We welcome everyone who wants to help us improve this downloader. As follows, we present some suggestions.

### Issuer
